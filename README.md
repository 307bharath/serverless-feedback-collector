# Serverless Feedback Collector (AWS)

This project is a serverless feedback collection system built using AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, and SES. It allows users to submit feedback (text and files) via a simple frontend, and stores it securely in the cloud.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (hosted on S3)
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch
- **Optional:** Amazon SES (for email notifications)

---

## üöÄ Architecture Workflow

1. Frontend hosted on **S3** allows users to submit feedback through a form.
2. **API Gateway** receives the HTTP POST request and triggers a **Lambda function**.
3. The **Lambda function**:
   - Parses and validates the input.
   - Stores feedback text in **DynamoDB**.
   - Uploads files (if any) to **S3**.
   - Sends a confirmation email via **SES** *(optional)*.
4. All events are logged in **CloudWatch Logs** for observability.
